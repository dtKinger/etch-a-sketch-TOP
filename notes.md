## Problem
Make an etch-a-sketch app.

## Constraints
* Dynamically generate a square grid between 16x16 boxes and 100x100 boxes within a fixed-size container. 960 pixels desktop, 480px on mobile.
  * Creating a new grid deletes and replaces any existing one.
  * Use CSS Grid
  * Place in a container
  * Use box-sizing: border-box;

* Build around "*hover*" or 'mouseover' and 'mouseout' events or maybe 'mouseenter' and 'mouseleave'.
* Change the color of the div on event by either:
  1. adding new class to div
  1. changing div's background color using JS
* 

## TO DO
1. Add a Clear button
1. Add a Hide gridlines button
1. Add an eraser / marker option
1. Add a colour picker - set variable in CSS
1. On clearSketch(), if Toggle Gridlines contains class 'clicked-in', toggle that button again.
